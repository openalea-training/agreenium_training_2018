For this a ratio with the heigth of the point cloud is prompted. Using default value of 50 gives you the following results.\n",

However, it is very sensitive to noise. Another method is to use the pipe model (See `Reconstruction>Radius>Pipe Model`). It requires an estimate of the radius of a first root node and of the leaves. From this a pipe exponent is determined and a value of radius for each node. Once the value of the radii are estimated, you can display a 3D representation of the tree with the menu `Reconstruction>3D Representation`.\n",
